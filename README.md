# the most basic csgo cheat

 a fully working glow esp and radar cheat for csgo

 the goal was to make it as small and simple as possible so it's not optimized in any way

 if compiled with the right project & compiler settings this will go as low as 1.5kb in size
 
 Update: it seems like people on uc made even smaller cheats with the same method
